                I focus on improving user experiences through thoughtful,
                well-structured software. I build systems by considering flow,
                reliability, and how each component contributes to the bigger
                picture. By planning architecture before features, I ensure
                solutions are stable, clear, and scalable. I approach
                development as an opportunity to create efficient, organized,
                and maintainable systems, combining practicality with curiosity
                to refine every step.
